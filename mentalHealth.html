    <p class = "illp">Mental illness is a very delicate topic to discuss. It is extremely important that you do not diagnose yourself or others based of off information you learn online.

    <p class = "teenp">Adolescence is a crucial period for developing and maintaining social and emotional habits that are important for mental well-being. These include adopting healthy sleep habits, taking regular exercise, developing coping mechanisms, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills, and learning to manage emotions. Supportive family, school, and community environments are also important. An estimated 10–20% of adolescents globally experience mental health issues, yet these remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. The more risk factors adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health is. Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include pressure to conform with peers, exploration of sexual identity, and increased access to and use of technology. Media influence and gender norms can increase the disparity between an adolescent’s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future.
