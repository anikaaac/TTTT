 <div id="protectiontxt"><center> When we are having sex, it's very important we do it safely. The are many differnt types of contraceptives we can use. The mostly commanly known contraceptive is the<strong> male condom.</strong> The male condom is 98% effective. Next, is the <strong>female condom.</strong> It is 95% effective. Both the male and female condom protect against STDs and prevent pregnancy.
 Another popular form of contraceptives are <strong>birth control pills.</strong>  Birth control pills are oral contraceptives and they are also hormonal. Birth control pills don't protect you from STDs. Other forms of contraceptives are<strong> the patch, the ring, IUDs, and the shot.</strong> These are all hormonal contraceptives and like birth control pills, they aren't going to protect you from STDs
